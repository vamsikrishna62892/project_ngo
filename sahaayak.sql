(1, NULL, 'wikipedia', 'Social isolation', 'Social isolation is a state of complete or near-complete lack of contact between an individual and society. It differs from loneliness, which reflects temporary and involuntary lack of contact with other humans in the world. Social isolation can be an issue for individuals of any age, though symptoms may differ by age group. Social isolation has similar characteristics in both temporary instances and for those with a historical lifelong isolation cycle. All types of social isolation can include staying home for lengthy periods of time, having no communication with family, acquaintances or friends, and/or avoiding any contact with other humans when those opportunities do arise. social isolation over years and decades can be a chronic condition affecting all aspects of a person\'s existence. Social isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. Lack of consistent human contact can also cause conflict with the (peripheral) friends the socially isolated person may occasionally talk to or cause problems with family members. The magnitude of risk associated with social isolation is comparable with that of cigarette smoking and other major biomedical and psycho-social risk factors. However, our understanding of how and why social isolation is risky for health or conversely how and why social ties and relationships are protective of health, still remains quite limited. In the case of mood-related isolation, the individual may isolate during a depressive episode only to \'surface\' when their mood improves. The individual may attempt to justify their reclusive or isolating behavior as enjoyable or comfortable. There can be an inner realization on the part of the individual that there is something wrong with their isolating responses which can lead to heightened anxiety. Relationships can be a struggle, as the individual may reconnect with others during a healthier mood only to return to an isolated state during a subsequent low or depressed mood.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation', '2020-07-07 15:48:34', '2020-07-07 15:48:34'),
(2, '1594137129.jpg', 'tiny buddha', 'Fear of loss and how to overcome it?', '“Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.” ~Norman Cousins Overcome fear of loss: 1. Ask yourself, “What am I scared of losing?” This may seem like an obvious question, but I’ve learned that it’s all too easy to go through our days, making choices, without recognizing the underlying feelings that motivate them. Whenever you have a choice to make, recognize in what way you’re motivated by the fear of losing something, whether it’s comfort, security, control, money, companionship, or something else. Once you understand what you’re scared of losing, you can… 2. Ascertain if you’re seeing the whole picture. There was a time when I worked sixty-plus hours/week to hold onto a job I didn’t even want. I was the last remaining US employee after a massive layoff, but I didn’t feel ready to lose that job. After several months of working long hours from home, I realized I’d never feel ready. It wasn’t until I finally got laid off that I started planning for this site. My logic was faulty—that it was best to stay with the sure thing, because I wasn’t ready to do something else—because the reality was that I needed the time and space to figure out that something else. In other words, loss was necessary to set me up for gain; it wasn’t the other way around. If you’re making a decision, or avoiding making a decision, based on the fear of what you might lose, ask yourself if you’re losing more by not doing what you really want to do. When you attempt to see beyond the fear, you’re better able to recognize if you’re keeping yourself stuck—and if you’d benefit from letting go of what you think you need. 3. Use loss aversion as motivation to pursue what you really want. In a post on Money Ning, Emily Guy Birken suggests we can benefit from the fear of loss by charting our progress toward a goal. Just as we don’t want to lose time and money, we don’t want to lose momentum. If you hang a large calendar on your wall, and put a star on every day when you do something positive—like exercise, practice a new hobby, or send out a resume for a new job—you’ll create a psychological need to keep that streak going. Birken writes, “Your disappointment in seeing a day without a gold star is greater than your happiness at any single day’s work.” Of course, you have to know what you really want first. 4. Regularly assess your intentions and motivations. This ties into the last one. Sometimes we think we want something because we’ve wanted it for years—and then we feel scared to lose that dream and all its related rewards. But sometimes, as we grow and learn about ourselves and the world, our wants change. A friend of mine racked up massive debt studying law, only to realize a couple years into her career that it didn’t fulfill her as she hoped it would. She’d built her whole life around this possibility—and she had close to $100,000 in student loans. She could easily have felt stuck, as if she’d lose too much if she walked away. But she did anyways. She moved to Chile and became a Pilates teacher, and though she ultimately realized she’d need to return to law for a while longer to pay off her debt, she’s released the emotional fears associated with pursuing a different path. And because she’s experienced the joy of doing something else, she now has a compelling motivation to do it again: She knows what she stands to gain is greater than what she stands to lose. If you’re forcing yourself to do something and a part of you feels it isn’t right, ask yourself, “Do I actually want this right now?” There’s a chance you do, and you’re just feeling frustrated and discouraged—but there’s also a chance you don’t anymore. Only you can know for sure what you really want. 5. Change how you see the inevitability of loss. The reality is that loss is inevitable. We will all lose relationships, situations, and states of being that we enjoy and love. Even if we practice non-attachment, on some level we will get comfortable with people and circumstances. You could say that this is what makes life beautiful and meaningful—since nothing lasts forever, each moment presents unique possibilities worth fully appreciating and savoring. Or you could say this is what makes life tragic—that everything is fleeting, and eventually it all slips away. How we choose to see things dictates how we’ll experience them. Would you rather see everything as precious or pointless? If we can choose the former, we can recognize that every loss provides opportunities for future gains—new relationships, experiences, and ways of being that may fulfill us in ways we can’t possibly predict. Of course, this can only happen if we trust in our ability to recognize and create these new connections and situations. We all have the potential to do it. Some losses feel devastating when we experience them—and sometimes, the gain isn’t proportionate to the loss. But somehow, we survive in the wake of almost every storm. Whether we thrive is up to us. That’s a choice we need to make proactively, not in response to what we fear, but in response to what we genuinely want to feel and do in this life. So I leave you with this question: Why are you afraid of losing? And are you ready to trust in yourself and your abilities so that you can get unstuck?', 'https://tinybuddha.com/blog/overcoming-the-fear-of-loss-5-steps-to-get-unstuck/', '2020-07-07 15:52:14', '2020-07-07 15:52:14'),
(3, '1594137343.jpg', 'www.psychologytoday.com', 'What is hopelessness and how to overcome it?', 'Hope involves a desire that is held with a certain conviction that the desire will be accomplished. To hope is to trust in certain future outcomes. The outcomes can include: a) an inner transformation (reduction in anxiety, greater inner peace, as examples); b) a change in relationships (finding one\'s true love, as an example); c) an alteration of environmental circumstances (better living conditions, a new job, more money); d) and transcendent expectations (eternal life of happiness). Hopelessness is the reverse of the above. One expects: a) the inner torment to continue; b) one will remain alone or in frustrated relationships; c) one will struggle with few worldly goods; and d) there is nothing other than this world; when one dies, that is the end of the story. Never Give Up There is much reason for hope, even when you can\'t see it at first. You can accidentally short-circuit hopelessness thoughts by flipping a page in a book and unexpectedly getting an idea that gives you a different perspective. The unexpected can happen in other ways, such as your depression may spontaneously lift. However, your best bet is to deal with hopelessness thinking by learning about this enemy and its points of vulnerability. Then work to weaken the vulnerable points until hopelessness thinking fades.', 'https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-forgiving-life/201901/hopelessness-and-how-defeat-it-part-1', '2020-07-07 15:55:48', '2020-07-07 15:55:48'),

A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy). Symptoms Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors. Examples of signs and symptoms include: 1)Feeling sad or down 2)Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate 3)Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guilt 4)Extreme mood changes of highs and lows 5)Withdrawal from friends and activities 6)Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping 7)Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations 8)Inability to cope with daily problems or stress 9)Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people 10)Problems with alcohol or drug use 11)Major changes in eating habits 12)Sex drive changes 13)Excessive anger, hostility or violence 14)Suicidal thinking', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/symptoms-causes/syc-20374968', '2020-07-07 15:59:14', '2020-07-07 15:59:14'),

Sleep helps reduce stress If your body doesn’t get enough sleep, it can react by producing an elevated level of stress hormones, which are a natural result of today’s fast-paced lifestyles. Deep and regular sleep can help prevent this. 2. Sleep can improve your memory Ever noticed that when you’re really tired it’s harder to remember things? Basically, this is your brain telling you that it’s not getting enough sleep. When you sleep well, your body may be resting but your brain is busy organising and storing memories. So getting more quality sleep will help you remember and process things better. 3. Sleep can lower your blood pressure Higher blood pressure increases your chances of heart attacks and strokes, but getting plenty of restful sleep encourages a constant state of relaxation that can help reduce blood pressure and generally keep it under control. 4. Sleep helps your body to fight back While you’re sleeping your body is producing extra protein molecules that can strengthen your ability to fight infections. If you’re feeling a bit run down and don’t want it to turn into a full-blown cold, go to bed early and get lots of rest. 5. Sleep can help you maintain your weight Unfortunately, sleep won’t directly make you lose weight, but it can help you keep it under control by regulating the hormones that affect your appetite and reducing your cravings for high calorie foods. 6. Sleep puts you in a better mood Lack of sleep can make us more agitated, so we’re more likely to snap at our boss or be grumpy with a loved one – neither of which is a good thing. The better you sleep, the better your ability to stay calm, controlled and reasonable. 7. Sleep could reduce your chances of diabetes Some research studies have shown that not getting enough sleep may lead to type 2 diabetes by affecting how your body processes glucose. It’s not conclusive by any means, but it’s yet another indication of how important the benefits of sleep can be. 8. Sleep helps keep your heart healthy A regular sleep pattern can help to lower the levels of stress and inflammation to your cardiovascular system, which in turn can reduce your chances of a heart condition. 9. Sleep can be a painkiller If you’re suffering pain from a recent injury like a sprained ankle, getting plenty of sleep can actually make it hurt less. Many studies have shown a link between sleep loss and a lower pain threshold. Basically the more sleep you get, the less pain you might be in. 10. Sleep can make you smarter Along with a great night’s sleep, grabbing a quick nap in the daytime can contribute towards making your brain more effective and productive. You won’t necessarily be answering all the questions on University Challenge, but you may well feel sharper, more attentive, and focused throughout the day.', 'https://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/top-10-benefits-good-nights-sleep/?tduid=e73f4d42a8e3a72f89bf84d95bb66b4c&utm_source=tradedoubler&utm_medium=adgoal+UK&utm_content=606733', '2020-07-07 16:03:39', '2020-07-07 16:03:39'),

Social stigmas can also be related to other characteristics including gender, sexuality, race, religion, and culture. Unfortunately, stigma surrounding mental health is still common. While stigma is not limited to mental conditions, attitudes towards psychiatric illnesses tend to be more negative than that toward medical conditions. Research has shown that stigma is one of the leading risk factors contributing to poor mental health outcomes. Stigma leads to delays in treatment. It also reduces the chances that a person with mental illness will receive appropriate and adequate care.1﻿ Signs of Stigma Examples of how stigma is perpetuated include: 1)Media depictions where the villain is often a character with a mental illness 2)Harmful stereotypes of people with mental illness 3)Treating mental health issues as if they are something people can overcome if they just \"try harder\" or \"snap out of it\" 4)Using phrases like \"she\'s crazy\" or \"he\'s nuts\" to describe other people or their behavior 5)Halloween costumes that depict people with mental illness as violent and dangerous Anyone who has had experience with mental illness, personally or professionally, can tell you that despite advances in psychiatry and psychology, a great deal of stigma remains. While people have become more informed about mental disorders in general, stigma continues to be a reality. Types of Stigma The stigma associated with mental illness can be divided into two types: Social stigma, which involves the prejudiced attitudes others have around mental illness Self-perceived stigma, which involves an internalized stigma the person with the mental illness suffers from Impact of Stigma The consequences of stigma can be serious and devastating. With stigma comes a lack of understanding from others, which can be invalidating and painful, but stigma also carries more serious consequences including fueling fear, anger, and intolerance directed at other people. People who are subjected to stigma are more likely to experience: 1)Reluctance to seek out treatment 2)Delayed treatment, which increases morbidity and mortality 3)Social rejection, avoidance, and isolation 4)Worse psychological well-being 5)Poor understanding among friends and family 6)Harassment, violence, or bullying 7)Poor quality of life, disability, and increased socioeconomic burden 8)Increased feelings of shame and self-doubt', 'https://www.verywellmind.com/mental-illness-and-stigma-2337677', '2020-07-07 16:09:45', '2020-07-07 16:09:45'),
(7, '1594138351.jpg', 'my.clevelandclinic.org', 'stress and how to reduce it', 'Stress is the body\'s reaction to any change that requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. Stress is a normal part of life. You can experience stress from your environment, your body, and your thoughts. Even positive life changes such as a promotion, a mortgage, or the birth of a child produce stress. How does stress affect health? The human body is designed to experience stress and react to it. Stress can be positive, keeping us alert, motivated, and ready to avoid danger. Stress becomes negative when a person faces continuous challenges without relief or relaxation between stressors. As a result, the person becomes overworked, and stress-related tension builds. The body\'s autonomic nervous system has a built-in stress response that causes physiological changes to allow the body to combat stressful situations. This stress response, also known as the \"fight or flight response\", is activated in case of an emergency. However, this response can become chronically activated during prolonged periods of stress. Prolonged activation of the stress response causes wear and tear on the body – both physical and emotional. Stress that continues without relief can lead to a condition called distress – a negative stress reaction. Distress can disturb the body\'s internal balance or equilibrium, leading to physical symptoms such as headaches, an upset stomach, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, sexual dysfunction, and problems sleeping. Emotional problems can also result from distress. These problems include depression, panic attacks, or other forms of anxiety and worry. Research suggests that stress also can bring on or worsen certain symptoms or diseases. Stress is linked to 6 of the leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide. Stress also becomes harmful when people engage in the compulsive use of substances or behaviors to try to relieve their stress. These substances or behaviors include food, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, gambling, sex, shopping, and the Internet. Rather than relieving the stress and returning the body to a relaxed state, these substances and compulsive behaviors tend to keep the body in a stressed state and cause more problems. The distressed person becomes trapped in a vicious circle. What are the warning signs of stress? Chronic stress can wear down the body\'s natural defenses, leading to a variety of physical symptoms, including the following: 1)Dizziness or a general feeling of \"being out of it.\" 2)General aches and pains. 3)Grinding teeth, clenched jaw. 4)Headaches. 5)Indigestion or acid reflux symptoms. 6)Increase in or loss of appetite. 7)Muscle tension in neck, face or shoulders. 8)Problems sleeping. 9)Racing heart. 10)Cold and sweaty palms. 11)Tiredness, exhaustion. 12)Trembling/shaking. 13)Weight gain or loss. 14)Upset stomach, diarrhea. 15)Sexual difficulties. Tips for reducing stress People can learn to manage stress and lead happier, healthier lives. You may want to begin with the following tips: 1)Keep a positive attitude. 2)Accept that there are events that you cannot control. 3)Be assertive instead of aggressive. Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, defensive, or passive. 4)Learn and practice relaxation techniques; try meditation, yoga, or tai-chi. 5)Exercise regularly. Your body can fight stress better when it is fit. 6)Eat healthy, well-balanced meals. 7)Learn to manage your time more effectively. 8)Set limits appropriately and say no to requests that would create excessive stress in your life. 9)Make time for hobbies and interests. 10)Get enough rest and sleep. Your body needs time to recover from stressful events. 11)Don\'t rely on alcohol, drugs, or compulsive behaviors to reduce stress. 12)Seek out social support. Spend enough time with those you love. 13)Seek treatment with a psychologist or other mental health professional trained in stress management or biofeedback techniques to learn more healthy ways of dealing with the stress in your life.', 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress', '2020-07-07 16:12:36', '2020-07-07 16:12:36'),

Causes: Suicidal ideas can occur when a person feels they are no longer able to cope with an overwhelming situation. This could stem from financial problems, death of a loved on, a broken relationship, or a devastating or debilitating illness. The most common situations or life events that might cause suicidal thoughts are grief, sexual abuse, financial problems, remorse, rejection, a relationship breakup, and unemployment. The following risk factors may have an impact on the probability of someone experiencing suicidal idea: a family history of mental health issues a family history of substance abuse a family history of violence a family history of suicide a feeling of hopelessness a feeling of seclusion or loneliness being gay with no family or home support being in trouble with the law being under the influence of alcohol or drugs for children, having disciplinary, social or school problems having a problem with substance abuse having a psychiatric disorder or mental illness having attempted suicide before being prone to reckless or impulsive behavior possessing a gun sleep deprivation knowing, identifying, or being associated with someone who has committed suicide Conditions that are linked to a higher risk of suicidal ideation include: adjustment disorder anorexia nervosa bipolar disorder body dysmorphic disorder borderline personality disorder dissociative identity disorder gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder major depressive disorder panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) schizophrenia social anxiety disorder generalized anxiety disorder substance abuse exposure to suicidal behavior in others Genetic factors may increase the risk of suicidal ideas.

Mental disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse—including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines are risk factors.Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress, such as from financial difficulties, relationship problems such as breakups, or bullying.Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts.Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance misuse; careful media reporting about suicide; and improving economic conditions.\r\n\r\nCauses:\r\nSuicidal ideas  can occur when a person feels they are no longer able to cope with an overwhelming situation. This could stem from financial problems, death of a loved on, a broken relationship, or a devastating or debilitating illness.\r\n\r\nThe most common situations or life events that might cause suicidal thoughts are grief, sexual abuse, financial problems, remorse, rejection, a relationship breakup, and unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe following risk factors may have an impact on the probability of someone experiencing suicidal idea:\r\n\r\na family history of mental health issues\r\na family history of substance abuse\r\na family history of violence\r\na family history of suicide\r\na feeling of hopelessness\r\na feeling of seclusion or loneliness\r\nbeing gay with no family or home support\r\nbeing in trouble with the law\r\nbeing under the influence of alcohol or drugs\r\nfor children, having disciplinary, social or school problems\r\nhaving a problem with substance abuse\r\nhaving a psychiatric disorder or mental illness\r\nhaving attempted suicide before\r\nbeing prone to reckless or impulsive behavior\r\npossessing a gun\r\nsleep deprivation\r\nknowing, identifying, or being associated with someone who has committed suicide\r\nConditions that are linked to a higher risk of suicidal ideation include:\r\n\r\nadjustment disorder\r\nanorexia nervosa\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nbody dysmorphic disorder\r\nborderline personality disorder\r\ndissociative identity disorder\r\ngender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\npanic disorder\r\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\r\nschizophrenia\r\nsocial anxiety disorder\r\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\r\nsubstance abuse\r\nexposure to suicidal behavior in others\r\nGenetic factors may increase the risk of suicidal ideas.

(5, 'Healthy sleep and its benefits to us', '1. Sleep helps reduce stress\r\nIf your body doesn’t get enough sleep, it can react by producing an elevated level of stress hormones, which are a natural result of today’s fast-paced lifestyles. Deep and regular sleep can help prevent this.\r\n\r\n2. Sleep can improve your memory\r\nEver noticed that when you’re really tired it’s harder to remember things? Basically, this is your brain telling you that it’s not getting enough sleep. When you sleep well, your body may be resting but your brain is busy organising and storing memories. So getting more quality sleep will help you remember and process things better.\r\n\r\n3. Sleep can lower your blood pressure\r\nHigher blood pressure increases your chances of heart attacks and strokes, but getting plenty of restful sleep encourages a constant state of relaxation that can help reduce blood pressure and generally keep it under control.\r\n\r\n4. Sleep helps your body to fight back\r\nWhile you’re sleeping your body is producing extra protein molecules that can strengthen your ability to fight infections. If you’re feeling a bit run down and don’t want it to turn into a full-blown cold, go to bed early and get lots of rest.\r\n\r\n5. Sleep can help you maintain your weight\r\nUnfortunately, sleep won’t directly make you lose weight, but it can help you keep it under control by regulating the hormones that affect your appetite and reducing your cravings for high calorie foods.\r\n\r\n6. Sleep puts you in a better mood\r\nLack of sleep can make us more agitated, so we’re more likely to snap at our boss or be grumpy with a loved one – neither of which is a good thing. The better you sleep, the better your ability to stay calm, controlled and reasonable.\r\n\r\n7. Sleep could reduce your chances of diabetes\r\nSome research studies have shown that not getting enough sleep may lead to type 2 diabetes by affecting how your body processes glucose. It’s not conclusive by any means, but it’s yet another indication of how important the benefits of sleep can be.\r\n\r\n8. Sleep helps keep your heart healthy\r\nA regular sleep pattern can help to lower the levels of stress and inflammation to your cardiovascular system, which in turn can reduce your chances of a heart condition.\r\n\r\n9. Sleep can be a painkiller\r\nIf you’re suffering pain from a recent injury like a sprained ankle, getting plenty of sleep can actually make it hurt less. Many studies have shown a link between sleep loss and a lower pain threshold. Basically the more sleep you get, the less pain you might be in.\r\n\r\n10. Sleep can make you smarter\r\nAlong with a great night’s sleep, grabbing a quick nap in the daytime can contribute towards making your brain more effective and productive.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\r\n\r\nDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\r\n\r\n1)Feeling sad or having a depressed mood\r\n2)Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\r\n3)Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\r\n4)Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much\r\n5)Loss of energy or increased fatigue\r\n6)Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\r\n7)Feeling worthless or guilty\r\n8)Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\r\n9)Thoughts of death or suicide\r\n\r\nSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\r\n\r\nAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\r\n\r\nDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.', 'Depression', 1, '3_1.jpg', 3, '2020-07-07 14:23:34', '2020-07-07 14:23:34'),

Mental disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse—including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines are risk factors.Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress, such as from financial difficulties, relationship problems such as breakups, or bullying.Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts.Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance misuse; careful media reporting about suicide; and improving economic conditions.\r\n\r\nCauses:\r\nSuicidal ideas  can occur when a person feels they are no longer able to cope with an overwhelming situation. This could stem from financial problems, death of a loved on, a broken relationship, or a devastating or debilitating illness.\r\n\r\nThe most common situations or life events that might cause suicidal thoughts are grief, sexual abuse, financial problems, remorse, rejection, a relationship breakup, and unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe following risk factors may have an impact on the probability of someone experiencing suicidal idea:\r\n\r\na family history of mental health issues\r\na family history of substance abuse\r\na family history of violence\r\na family history of suicide\r\na feeling of hopelessness\r\na feeling of seclusion or loneliness\r\nbeing gay with no family or home support\r\nbeing in trouble with the law\r\nbeing under the influence of alcohol or drugs\r\nfor children, having disciplinary, social or school problems\r\nhaving a problem with substance abuse\r\nhaving a psychiatric disorder or mental illness\r\nhaving attempted suicide before\r\nbeing prone to reckless or impulsive behavior\r\npossessing a gun\r\nsleep deprivation\r\nknowing, identifying, or being associated with someone who has committed suicide\r\nConditions that are linked to a higher risk of suicidal ideation include:\r\n\r\nadjustment disorder\r\nanorexia nervosa\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nbody dysmorphic disorder\r\nborderline personality disorder\r\ndissociative identity disorder\r\ngender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\npanic disorder\r\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\r\nschizophrenia\r\nsocial anxiety disorder\r\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\r\nsubstance abuse\r\nexposure to suicidal behavior in others\r\nGenetic factors may increase the risk of suicidal ideas.

(3, 'What is stress and how to reduce stress?', 'What is stress?\r\nStress is the body\'s reaction to any change that requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. Stress is a normal part of life. You can experience stress from your environment, your body, and your thoughts. Even positive life changes such as a promotion, a mortgage, or the birth of a child produce stress.\r\n\r\nHow does stress affect health?\r\nThe human body is designed to experience stress and react to it. Stress can be positive, keeping us alert, motivated, and ready to avoid danger. Stress becomes negative when a person faces continuous challenges without relief or relaxation between stressors. As a result, the person becomes overworked, and stress-related tension builds. The body\'s autonomic nervous system has a built-in stress response that causes physiological changes to allow the body to combat stressful situations. This stress response, also known as the \"fight or flight response\", is activated in case of an emergency. However, this response can become chronically activated during prolonged periods of stress. Prolonged activation of the stress response causes wear and tear on the body – both physical and emotional.\r\n\r\nStress that continues without relief can lead to a condition called distress – a negative stress reaction. Distress can disturb the body\'s internal balance or equilibrium, leading to physical symptoms such as headaches, an upset stomach, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, sexual dysfunction, and problems sleeping. Emotional problems can also result from distress. These problems include depression, panic attacks, or other forms of anxiety and worry. Research suggests that stress also can bring on or worsen certain symptoms or diseases. Stress is linked to 6 of the leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide.\r\n\r\nStress also becomes harmful when people engage in the compulsive use of substances or behaviors to try to relieve their stress. These substances or behaviors include food, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, gambling, sex, shopping, and the Internet. Rather than relieving the stress and returning the body to a relaxed state, these substances and compulsive behaviors tend to keep the body in a stressed state and cause more problems. The distressed person becomes trapped in a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nWhat are the warning signs of stress?\r\nChronic stress can wear down the body\'s natural defenses, leading to a variety of physical symptoms, including the following:\r\n\r\n1)Dizziness or a general feeling of \"being out of it.\"\r\n2)General aches and pains.\r\n3)Grinding teeth, clenched jaw.\r\n4)Headaches.\r\n5)Indigestion or acid reflux symptoms.\r\n6)Increase in or loss of appetite.\r\n7)Muscle tension in neck, face or shoulders.\r\n8)Problems sleeping.\r\n9)Racing heart.\r\n10)Cold and sweaty palms.\r\n11)Tiredness, exhaustion.\r\n12)Trembling/shaking.\r\n13)Weight gain or loss.\r\n14)Upset stomach, diarrhea.\r\n15)Sexual difficulties.\r\n\r\nTips for reducing stress\r\nPeople can learn to manage stress and lead happier, healthier lives. You may want to begin with the following tips:\r\n\r\n1)Keep a positive attitude.\r\n2)Accept that there are events that you cannot control.\r\n3)Be assertive instead of aggressive. Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, defensive, or passive.\r\n4)Learn and practice relaxation techniques; try meditation, yoga, or tai-chi.\r\n5)Exercise regularly. Your body can fight stress better when it is fit.\r\n6)Eat healthy, well-balanced meals.\r\n7)Learn to manage your time more effectively.\r\n8)Set limits appropriately and say no to requests that would create excessive stress in your life.\r\n9)Make time for hobbies and interests.\r\n10)Get enough rest and sleep. Your body needs time to recover from stressful events.\r\n11)Don\'t rely on alcohol, drugs, or compulsive behaviors to reduce stress.\r\n12)Seek out social support. Spend enough time with those you love.\r\n13)Seek treatment with a psychologist or other mental health professional trained in stress management or biofeedback techniques to learn more healthy ways of dealing with the stress in your life.', 'Stress', 1, '3_3.jpg', 3, '2020-07-07 14:55:07', '2020-07-07 14:55:07'),

While stigma is not limited to mental conditions, attitudes towards psychiatric illnesses tend to be more negative than that toward medical conditions.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that stigma is one of the leading risk factors contributing to poor mental health outcomes. Stigma leads to delays in treatment. It also reduces the chances that a person with mental illness will receive appropriate and adequate care.1﻿\r\n\r\nSigns of Stigma\r\nExamples of how stigma is perpetuated include:\r\n\r\n1)Media depictions where the villain is often a character with a mental illness\r\n2)Harmful stereotypes of people with mental illness\r\n3)Treating mental health issues as if they are something people can overcome if they just \"try harder\" or \"snap out of it\"\r\n4)Using phrases like \"she\'s crazy\" or \"he\'s nuts\" to describe other people or their behavior\r\n5)Halloween costumes that depict people with mental illness as violent and dangerous\r\n\r\nAnyone who has had experience with mental illness, personally or professionally, can tell you that despite advances in psychiatry and psychology, a great deal of stigma remains. While people have become more informed about mental disorders in general, stigma continues to be a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes of Stigma\r\nThe stigma associated with mental illness can be divided into two types:\r\n\r\nSocial stigma, which involves the prejudiced attitudes others have around mental illness\r\nSelf-perceived stigma, which involves an internalized stigma the person with the mental illness suffers from\r\n\r\nImpact of Stigma\r\nThe consequences of stigma can be serious and devastating.

(5, 'Healthy sleep and its benefits to us', '1. Sleep helps reduce stress\r\nIf your body doesn’t get enough sleep, it can react by producing an elevated level of stress hormones, which are a natural result of today’s fast-paced lifestyles. Deep and regular sleep can help prevent this.\r\n\r\n2. Sleep can improve your memory\r\nEver noticed that when you’re really tired it’s harder to remember things? Basically, this is your brain telling you that it’s not getting enough sleep. When you sleep well, your body may be resting but your brain is busy organising and storing memories. So getting more quality sleep will help you remember and process things better.\r\n\r\n3. Sleep can lower your blood pressure\r\nHigher blood pressure increases your chances of heart attacks and strokes, but getting plenty of restful sleep encourages a constant state of relaxation that can help reduce blood pressure and generally keep it under control.\r\n\r\n4. Sleep helps your body to fight back\r\nWhile you’re sleeping your body is producing extra protein molecules that can strengthen your ability to fight infections. If you’re feeling a bit run down and don’t want it to turn into a full-blown cold, go to bed early and get lots of rest.\r\n\r\n5. Sleep can help you maintain your weight\r\nUnfortunately, sleep won’t directly make you lose weight, but it can help you keep it under control by regulating the hormones that affect your appetite and reducing your cravings for high calorie foods.\r\n\r\n6. Sleep puts you in a better mood\r\nLack of sleep can make us more agitated, so we’re more likely to snap at our boss or be grumpy with a loved one – neither of which is a good thing. The better you sleep, the better your ability to stay calm, controlled and reasonable.\r\n\r\n7. Sleep could reduce your chances of diabetes\r\nSome research studies have shown that not getting enough sleep may lead to type 2 diabetes by affecting how your body processes glucose. It’s not conclusive by any means, but it’s yet another indication of how important the benefits of sleep can be.\r\n\r\n8. Sleep helps keep your heart healthy\r\nA regular sleep pattern can help to lower the levels of stress and inflammation to your cardiovascular system, which in turn can reduce your chances of a heart condition.\r\n\r\n9. Sleep can be a painkiller\r\nIf you’re suffering pain from a recent injury like a sprained ankle, getting plenty of sleep can actually make it hurt less. Many studies have shown a link between sleep loss and a lower pain threshold. Basically the more sleep you get, the less pain you might be in.\r\n\r\n10. Sleep can make you smarter\r\nAlong with a great night’s sleep, grabbing a quick nap in the daytime can contribute towards making your brain more effective and productive. You won’t necessarily be answering all the questions on University Challenge, but you may well feel sharper, more attentive, and focused throughout the day.', 'Healthy Sleep', 1, '3_5.jpg', 3, '2020-07-07 15:18:31', '2020-07-07 15:18:31'),

But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.\r\n\r\nA mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships.

(7, 'What is hopelessness and how to overcome it?', 'Hope involves a desire that is held with a certain conviction that the desire will be accomplished.  To hope is to trust in certain future outcomes.  The outcomes can include: a) an inner transformation (reduction in anxiety, greater inner peace, as examples); b) a change in relationships (finding one\'s true love, as an example); c) an alteration of environmental circumstances (better living conditions, a new job, more money); d) and transcendent expectations (eternal life of happiness).   \r\n\r\nHopelessness is the reverse of the above.  One expects: a) the inner torment to continue; b) one will remain alone or in frustrated relationships; c) one will struggle with few worldly goods; and d) there is nothing other than this world; when one dies, that is the end of the story.\r\n\r\nNever Give Up\r\nThere is much reason for hope, even when you can\'t see it at first. You can accidentally short-circuit hopelessness thoughts by flipping a page in a book and unexpectedly getting an idea that gives you a different perspective. The unexpected can happen in other ways, such as your depression may spontaneously lift. However, your best bet is to deal with hopelessness thinking by learning about this enemy and its points of vulnerability.

(8, 'Fear of loss and how to overcome it?', '“Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.” ~Norman Cousins\r\n\r\nOvercome fear of loss:\r\n1. Ask yourself, “What am I scared of losing?”\r\nThis may seem like an obvious question, but I’ve learned that it’s all too easy to go through our days, making choices, without recognizing the underlying feelings that motivate them.\r\n\r\nWhenever you have a choice to make, recognize in what way you’re motivated by the fear of losing something, whether it’s comfort, security, control, money, companionship, or something else.\r\n\r\nOnce you understand what you’re scared of losing, you can…\r\n\r\n2. Ascertain if you’re seeing the whole picture.\r\nThere was a time when I worked sixty-plus hours/week to hold onto a job I didn’t even want. I was the last remaining US employee after a massive layoff, but I didn’t feel ready to lose that job.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of working long hours from home, I realized I’d never feel ready. It wasn’t until I finally got laid off that I started planning for this site.\r\n\r\nMy logic was faulty—that it was best to stay with the sure thing, because I wasn’t ready to do something else—because the reality was that I needed the time and space to figure out that something else.\r\n\r\nIn other words, loss was necessary to set me up for gain; it wasn’t the other way around.\r\n\r\nIf you’re making a decision, or avoiding making a decision, based on the fear of what you might lose, ask yourself if you’re losing more by not doing what you really want to do.\r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to see beyond the fear, you’re better able to recognize if you’re keeping yourself stuck—and if you’d benefit from letting go of what you think you need.\r\n\r\n3. Use loss aversion as motivation to pursue what you really want.\r\nIn a post on Money Ning, Emily Guy Birken suggests we can benefit from the fear of loss by charting our progress toward a goal. Just as we don’t want to lose time and money, we don’t want to lose momentum.\r\n\r\nIf you hang a large calendar on your wall, and put a star on every day when you do something positive—like exercise, practice a new hobby, or send out a resume for a new job—you’ll create a psychological need to keep that streak going.\r\n\r\nBirken writes, “Your disappointment in seeing a day without a gold star is greater than your happiness at any single day’s work.”\r\n\r\nOf course, you have to know what you really want first.\r\n\r\n4. Regularly assess your intentions and motivations.\r\nThis ties into the last one. Sometimes we think we want something because we’ve wanted it for years—and then we feel scared to lose that dream and all its related rewards.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, as we grow and learn about ourselves and the world, our wants change.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine racked up massive debt studying law, only to realize a couple years into her career that it didn’t fulfill her as she hoped it would. She’d built her whole life around this possibility—and she had close to $100,000 in student loans.\r\n\r\nShe could easily have felt stuck, as if she’d lose too much if she walked away. But she did anyways. She moved to Chile and became a Pilates teacher, and though she ultimately realized she’d need to return to law for a while longer to pay off her debt, she’s released the emotional fears associated with pursuing a different path.\r\n\r\nAnd because she’s experienced the joy of doing something else, she now has a compelling motivation to do it again: She knows what she stands to gain is greater than what she stands to lose.\r\n\r\nIf you’re forcing yourself to do something and a part of you feels it isn’t right, ask yourself, “Do I actually want this right now?” There’s a chance you do, and you’re just feeling frustrated and discouraged—but there’s also a chance you don’t anymore. Only you can know for sure what you really want.\r\n\r\n5. Change how you see the inevitability of loss.\r\nThe reality is that loss is inevitable.\r\n\r\nWe will all lose relationships, situations, and states of being that we enjoy and love. Even if we practice non-attachment, on some level we will get comfortable with people and circumstances.\r\n\r\nYou could say that this is what makes life beautiful and meaningful—since nothing lasts forever, each moment presents unique possibilities worth fully appreciating and savoring.\r\n\r\nOr you could say this is what makes life tragic—that everything is fleeting, and eventually it all slips away.\r\n\r\nHow we choose to see things dictates how we’ll experience them. Would you rather see everything as precious or pointless?\r\n\r\nIf we can choose the former, we can recognize that every loss provides opportunities for future gains—new relationships, experiences, and ways of being that may fulfill us in ways we can’t possibly predict.\r\n\r\nOf course, this can only happen if we trust in our ability to recognize and create these new connections and situations. We all have the potential to do it.\r\n\r\nSome losses feel devastating when we experience them—and sometimes, the gain isn’t proportionate to the loss.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, we survive in the wake of almost every storm. Whether we thrive is up to us. That’s a choice we need to make proactively, not in response to what we fear, but in response to what we genuinely want to feel and do in this life.\r\n\r\nSo I leave you with this question: Why are you afraid of losing? And are you ready to trust in yourself and your abilities so that you can get unstuck?', 'Fear of Loss', 1, '3_8.jpg', 3, '2020-07-07 15:36:30', '2020-07-07 15:36:30'),
(9, 'What is social isolation and its effects?', 'Social isolation is a state of complete or near-complete lack of contact between an individual and society. It differs from loneliness, which reflects temporary and involuntary lack of contact with other humans in the world. Social isolation can be an issue for individuals of any age, though symptoms may differ by age group.\r\n\r\nSocial isolation has similar characteristics in both temporary instances and for those with a historical lifelong isolation cycle. All types of social isolation can include staying home for lengthy periods of time, having no communication with family, acquaintances or friends, and/or  avoiding any contact with other humans when those opportunities do arise.\r\n\r\nsocial isolation over years and decades can be a chronic condition affecting all aspects of a person\'s existence. Social isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. Lack of consistent human contact can also cause conflict with the (peripheral) friends the socially isolated person may occasionally talk to or cause problems with family members.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of risk associated with social isolation is comparable with that of cigarette smoking and other major biomedical and psycho-social risk factors. However, our understanding of how and why social isolation is risky for health or conversely how and why social ties and relationships are protective of health, still remains quite limited.\r\n\r\nIn the case of mood-related isolation, the individual may isolate during a depressive episode only to \'surface\' when their mood improves. The individual may attempt to justify their reclusive or isolating behavior as enjoyable or comfortable. There can be an inner realization on the part of the individual that there is something wrong with their isolating responses which can lead to heightened anxiety. Relationships can be a struggle, as the individual may reconnect with others during a healthier mood only to return to an isolated state during a subsequent low or depressed mood.', 'Social Isolation', 1, '3_9.jpg', 3, '2020-07-07 15:42:43', '2020-07-07 15:42:43'),
